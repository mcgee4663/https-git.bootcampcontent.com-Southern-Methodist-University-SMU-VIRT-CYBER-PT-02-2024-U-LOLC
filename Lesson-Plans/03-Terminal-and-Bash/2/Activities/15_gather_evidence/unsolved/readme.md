## Activity File: Gather Evidence
 
- In this activity, you will continue your role as a security analyst at Candy Corp. 

- Candy Corp believes it has enough evidence to send to the authorities to have Sugar Corp charged with a cyber crime. 

- Your task is to gather several points of evidence from your file systems that can be provided to the authorities to prove Sugar is stealing data.

### Instructions

Using only the command line, continue to complete the following tasks in the `/03-student/day2/Gathering_Evidence` folder in your Ubuntu virtual machine:

1.  In the `Gathering_Evidence` folder, make a directory called `Sugar_evidence`.

2. The `email` directory contains an archive of emails from the employees.

   Place into a new file called `sugar_email_evidence` the following data:

   - List of emails referencing Sugar

   - Number of emails referencing Sugar
  
    **Hint:** Use the pipe and redirection command to append the additional data to this file.
    
 3. The `web_logs` directory contains an archive of web log access by date for PeanutButtery.net. The IP of Sugar, which is a numerical number that identifies an address on the network, is `13.16.23.234`.

    Place into a new file called `sugar_web_evidence` the following data:
    
      - Which web log file contains the IP address of Sugar

      - The number of times Sugar's IP is found in this file
    
4. Move the two new evidence files into the directory `Sugar_evidence`.
   
5.  Combine them both into a single file called `Sugar_evidence_for_authorities`.
